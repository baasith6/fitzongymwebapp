    <p>Eating clean isn't about strict limitations or depriving yourself. It’s about feeling great, having more energy, and stabilizing your mood. Focus on real, whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.</p>
    <p>Plan your meals ahead of time. Include balanced portions of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in every meal. Portion control is key — even healthy foods can lead to weight gain when overconsumed.</p>
    <p>Don't forget hydration! Drinking enough water boosts metabolism and helps control hunger. Nourish your body; it’s the only one you have.</p>
